# nma.simple

A simple tool for feature extraction from
matrices with only positive or zero elements.
The algorithm in this module was written closely
following

"Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix Factorization"
By Daniel D. Lee and H. Sebastian Seung, 2001

Use of nma.simple requires incanter 
(http://incanter.org)


## Usage

(use 'nma.simple)
(def giganticus 
  (for [ i (range 400) ]
    (for [ j (range 500) ]
      (+ 3 (* 
            (Math/sin (/ (* 2 Math/PI) i))
            (Math/cos (/ (* 2 Math/PI) j)))))))


(non-negative-factor-approx giganticus 10)

;; OR

(require 'nma.demo)
(nma.demo/image-demo "test/mona-lisa-bw.png" 
		     "test/mona-lisa-factored.png" 20)
